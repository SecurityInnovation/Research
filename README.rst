:Abstract:
  Wearable computers have been pursued for decades as an inevitable and transformative technology, one with the plausible capability of changing our relationships with each other and the world around us. The “Explorer Program” was introduced in early 2013 and was unceremoniously cancelled in January 2015 after finding trouble gaining widespread adoption or social acceptance. Due to various testing constraints described in more detail below, along with the high retail price of the device when it was available for purchase, little security analysis of the device’s attack surface, architecture, or custom software was made available to the general public. In the hope of making this type of analysis easier for future wearable embedded devices, this paper details many of the steps and processes needed to configure Google Glass for security testing.
